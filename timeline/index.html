	    <title> Artist Synthesis: Line Graph and Timeline</title>
<p1> For this project, Everett and I teamed up to make a line graph and timeline that showed the number of executed offenders per year and some historical context over time. For example, the Supreme Court has become more strict with their death penalty rulings throughout history. And, as we can see in the line graph, the number of executions in Texas per year has dwindled because of that. Everett worked on the linegraph, and I worked on the timeline. We decided to use the hover tool in Bokeh to show the historical events, which I think is a really cool effect because you see the number of executed offenders compared to what was happening nationally at the time. Everett decided to add hashes on the graph to mimic barbed wire, which I think is a really creative, artistic touch! This graph sort of explains why the executions were high for a particular year. For example, from 1996 to 1999, there were a total of 92 executions because Texas passed a law saying that death row appeals to be filed to reduce the time prisoners spent on death row -- meaning they wait less time before getting executed </p1>
<title> Why this graph is important </title>
<p2> This graph is important because it combines a visual representation of the number of executions over the years and a historical record of the death penalty in Texas. It provides a good overview for someone who doesn't want to dig through a CSV or go down the Texas execution rabbit hole.
<title> Where I pulled my information</title>
<p3> I pulled my information from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice website -- they literally have a page called Death Row Facts <a href=" http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html">Source</a> and from different article from sources like The Guardian <a href=" https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/02/texas-execution-mentally-ill-history-scott-panetti">Source</a>, the Texas Execution Information Center <a href="http://www.txexecutions.org/history.asp">Source</a> and the Texas Tribune <a href= "https://www.texastribune.org/2014/07/08/history-lethal-drug-use-texas/">Source</a>. I used most of these sources to find both information about Supreme Court rulings over the years, changes in Texas laws to the death penalty, changes to the drugs used in executions and changes to those who are elegible for execution. I thought the latter was the most interesting thing I learned from gathering my research. It wasn't until 2005 that they said that prisoners who committed capital offenses when they were juveniles couldn't be put on death row. Considering Texas has had the death penalty in place since at least 1923, that means countless people have been executed for crimes they committed as juveniles, which I think is really interesting.</p3>
<title> What I would change </title>
<p4> I noticed after making the graph and looking at where the Bokeh hover tool landed on the timeline that there were some gaps in my information. I should have found some more information for the year 2000 because that year was the highest year historically for executions in Texas and there is nothing historically in the interactive that explains why that was so. </p4>
